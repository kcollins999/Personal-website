                <p>I really enjoy a good book. It could be informational or fiction. 
                    I like suspense and thiller books. I feel they create a good storyline.
                     I also enjoy books with comedy and drama. I love informative books on nutrition and health. 
                     Learning about different herbs for certain illness and sickness. </p>
